"""Post-download processing pipeline.

This module is the public API surface for post-download processing.

Implementation lives in submodules in this package:

- `types`: dataclasses used across the pipeline
- `workspace`: managed workspace + cleanup rules
- `scan`: directory scanning + archive extraction
- `transfer`: hardlink/copy/move + naming/organization
- `prepare`: staging plan + prepared file selection
- `steps`: lightweight plan logging helpers

Keeping this file as a facade avoids churn in call sites while letting the
implementation stay modular.
